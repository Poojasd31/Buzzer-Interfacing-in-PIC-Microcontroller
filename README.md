# Buzzer-Interfacing-in-PIC-Microcontroller

## Description:
This program demonstrates how to interface a buzzer with a PIC microcontroller. Buzzers can be used to generate sound alerts or tones in embedded systems. The PIC controls the buzzer by sending digital HIGH/LOW signals or PWM signals to produce sound.

## Types of Buzzers:
Active Buzzer – Generates sound when a DC voltage is applied.
Passive Buzzer – Requires a PWM signal to generate different tones.

## Circuit Connections:
PIC Pin	Buzzer Pin	Function
RA0/RC0	+	Buzzer Positive Input
GND	-	Buzzer Ground

## Applications:

Alarm systems (fire, security)
Notification systems in embedded projects
Timers and reminders
Feedback sound in microcontroller-based devices
